# üè® Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis  

## üìå Project Overview  
In recent years, **City Hotel** and **Resort Hotel** have seen high cancellation rates, leading to revenue loss and inefficient room utilization.  
This project analyzes hotel booking cancellations, identifies key factors influencing them, and provides data-driven business suggestions to reduce cancellations and improve revenue.

## ‚ùì Business Problem  
High cancellation rates have resulted in:  
- Lower revenues  
- Poor utilization of hotel capacity  
- Difficulty in forecasting demand  

The **primary goal** is to uncover the drivers of cancellations and provide actionable recommendations for hotel management.

## üîç Hypotheses  
1. More cancellations occur when prices are higher.  
2. Longer waiting lists increase the likelihood of cancellations.  
3. The majority of clients make reservations through offline travel agents.  

---

## üéØ Research Questions  
1. What variables affect hotel reservation cancellations?  
2. How can hotels reduce reservation cancellations?  
3. How can data insights assist hotels in making pricing and promotional decisions?

## üí° Suggestions  
1. **Pricing Strategy** ‚Äì Cancellations increase as prices rise. Hotels should optimize pricing and provide location-based discounts.  
2. **Resort Hotel Focus** ‚Äì Resort hotels have higher cancellation ratios. Discounts during weekends and holidays can help.  
3. **Seasonal Campaigns** ‚Äì January shows the highest cancellations. Hotels should run targeted campaigns to attract and retain customers.  
4. **Quality Improvements** ‚Äì Enhancing hotel quality and service, especially in Portugal, can help lower cancellations.

City Hotels receive a higher volume of bookings compared to Resort Hotels.  
This may be attributed to **price differences**, as Resort Hotels tend to be more expensive.

The line graph highlights fluctuations in **average daily rates (ADR)** between City and Resort Hotels.  
As expected, **Resort Hotel rates rise during weekends and holidays**, making them costlier compared to City Hotels.

This grouped bar chart shows reservation patterns across months.  
- **August** records the highest number of both confirmed and canceled reservations.  
- **January** stands out as the month with the highest cancellation rate.

The bar chart demonstrates a clear relationship between **price and cancellations**:  
- Higher ADR ‚Üí Higher cancellations  
- Lower ADR ‚Üí Lower cancellations  

This supports the hypothesis that **pricing directly influences booking cancellations**.
